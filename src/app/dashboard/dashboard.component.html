<h1>dashboard works!</h1>
<p>
    This will be like a super component for the DashBoard page. <br>We can divide the entire dashboard into three sub components.
</p> <ol>

   <li>Dashboard tile view from top portion</li>
    <li>the navigation bar with multiple lists form middle portion</li>
    <li>graph display will be the bottom portion</li></ol>
<p>
    Each of this three is a seperate component and will be intergrated here with its own module routing and services.
